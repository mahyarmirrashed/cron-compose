# Roadmap

- Add ability to chaining human readable functions
- Add intersection and union between `CronComposer` instances
- Add methods to set common presets like hourly, daily, etc. which would be shorthand for certain common schedules
- Add documentation for functions within the library (typedoc format standard)
- Add cron string parser (should detect with seconds or without seconds)
