# Roadmap

- Add method to generate a human-readable description of the cron schedule similar to [crontab guru's output](https://crontab.guru/)
- Add intersection and union between `CronComposer` instances
- Add methods to set common presets like hourly, daily, etc. which would be shorthand for certain common schedules
